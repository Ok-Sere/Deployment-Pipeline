# Deployment Pipeline to AWS S3 â€“ Project Walkthrough

This project demonstrates how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** to automatically build and deploy a React application to an **AWS S3 bucket**.  
Below, each screenshot in the README is explained in the context of the deployment process, including errors encountered and how they were resolved.

---

## 1. Repository Setup

The project begins with a GitHub repository containing a basic React app structure. This is the foundation for the deployment pipeline.

---

## 2. Creating the GitHub Actions Workflow

A workflow file is created in `.github/workflows/deploy-to-aws.yml`. This file defines the steps for the CI/CD pipeline, such as checking out code, installing dependencies, building the app, and deploying to S3.

---

## 3. Writing the Workflow Script

The initial workflow script is written. It includes steps for checking out the code, setting up AWS credentials, installing dependencies, building the project, and deploying to S3.

---

## 4. Setting Up AWS Credentials in GitHub

AWS credentials (`ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) are securely stored as GitHub repository secrets. This allows the workflow to authenticate with AWS without exposing sensitive information.

---

## 5. Creating the S3 Bucket

An S3 bucket is created in the AWS Console. This bucket will receive the deployed files from the workflow.

---

## 6. Updating the Workflow Script

The workflow script is updated and refined to ensure all necessary steps are included and the correct bucket name is used.

---

## 7. Encountering and Debugging Errors

### Error: Build Directory Not Found

![8](./img/8.%20error.jpg)  
![9](./img/9.%20debug.jpg)

The workflow fails because the `build` directory does not exist. This usually means the React app did not build successfully, often due to missing files or dependencies.

---

### Error: Missing Required Files

![10](./img/10.%20error%202.jpg)  
![11](./img/11.%20solution%202.jpg)

The workflow reports missing required files such as `index.html` or `index.js`. The solution is to ensure that `public/index.html` and `src/index.js` exist in the project.

---

### Error: Module Parse Failed

![12](./img/12.%20error%203.jpg)  
![13](./img/13.%20solution%203.jpg)

A module parse error occurs due to an incorrect `"type"` field in `package.json` or improper use of ES module syntax. The solution is to remove `"type": "commonjs"` from `package.json` and ensure ES module syntax is used.

---

### Error: Missing Dependencies

![14](./img/14.%20error%204.jpg)  
![15](./img/15.%20solution%205.jpg)

The workflow fails because dependencies like `react` and `react-dom` are missing. Adding these to `package.json` resolves the issue.

---

## 8. Successful Deployment

![16](./img/16.%20deployed%20ao%20aws.jpg)

After resolving all errors, the workflow completes successfully and deploys the app to AWS S3.

---

## 9. Verifying the Deployment

The deployed files are visible in the S3 bucket, confirming that the CI/CD pipeline is working as intended.

---

## Summary

This project walks through the process of setting up a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy a React app to AWS S3, including:
- Repository and workflow setup
- AWS credential management
- S3 bucket creation
- Debugging and resolving common errors
- Achieving a successful automated deployment

The screenshots provide a visual guide to each step and the troubleshooting process, making it easier to understand and replicate the setup.
